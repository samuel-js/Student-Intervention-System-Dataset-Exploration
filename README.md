# Student Intervention System - Dataset Exploration
## by (Samuel Jim√©nez Sanabria)


## Dataset

During my research to study Machine Learning at Udacity I discovered a capstone project called "Building a Student Intervention System". I was instantly captured by this project as it lies very close to my daily job as an Educational IT Strategist and Analyst. 
Upon contacting Udacity I discovered that the project wasn't part of the program anymore but the the code and projects from the students were available on GitHub for everyone to study. I immediately started to study the notebooks and eventualy started to develop my own models. The focus of the Student Intervention System capstone projects is the development of the prediction models, not the visualizations. And even if some projects show maybe one or two charts, visualizations for this project have not been explored. That's the main reason I choose this dataset to work with visualizations.
The dataset collects a number of features that can be related to the student success. The last column "passed", indicates if the student managed to pass the final exams or not.
This dataset is intended to be used to create prediction models but can also be used to study social and pedagogical conditions where the learning process has been taking place. The dataset includes observations for a single school of 395 students, which is not a lot, but probably enough to get some insights.


## Summary of Findings

The number of observations and visualizations is limited in this project. The number of features and correlation could be extended and studied much moire in detail. But I think we get some interesting points and general ideas of how this school works both socially and academically. The type of visualizations is also a bit limited looking at the type of features. We have a lot of categorical values and very little continuous numerical features. We don't have time frames or region frames either. But I think the the data provides a lot of interesting insights in this field. Visuals don't ned to be very complicated to show concise points.

We've also seen the the school's social aspects seem to be 'normal': students that study regularly, and generally functional families who live close to the school.

Through the lines of code and the visuslizations we've been able to observe how different factors affect the student's final result. Some factors have a positive affect, like if the student have intetion to continue studing after the end of the course or the amount of time they study. Other factors have a negative effect, like how much they go out or the amount of previous failures.

We've observed very strong correlations like the age or previous failures related to the final result. And very weak correlations like the one between the amount of absences and previous failures. But there is not a single deciding factor. The result is a combination of ircumstances that could be explored in much more detail.

So how is it possible, based on the observations, that only 2/3 of the students pass? What we know from the last graph is that showing up and studying will help for sure, but it's not enough. To answer this question a much deeper analysis is needed. A very exciting question to answer but which for now need to remain a 'mystery'. Let's say "to be continued..."

To give some light I'd like to conclude saying that this unanswered question is one of the reasons why education is so exciting and so difficult: all the factors point to one direction (like these student's generally favorable conditions for learning) but the result in unexpected (like the fact that only 2/3 of the students passed the course).


## Key Insights for Presentation
From all the analysis and visualizations I take three basic points for the presentation:
	
- There are affecting factors but no decisive factors when looking at what may have an impact on student results. 
- The students have generally favorable conditions for learning.
- Studying and going to school is a good starting point for a good result.
